# Final-project

This is a film library which shows title, director, release year, shown status, and cover art.  The user can add or delete a film by entering the data in the textbox.  We started with wireframing the website and assigning tasks.  Edmond took the lead on design and Lauren took the lead on the functionality.  The JavaScript functions were created by Lauren Hepburn.  The HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and other design  were created by Edmond Penn. Poster art was contributed by Phillis Kwentoh.
